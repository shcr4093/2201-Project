# 2201-Project
This is Shane's project for INFO 2201
This project explores long term trends in NBA team performance and league evolution from the 2000s to present. Using Python and popular data science libraries, the analysis focuses on how the game has changed in terms of team scoring pace, 3-point shooting, and overall shooting efficiency.

The goal is to tell a data-driven story through clear visuals and well-organized insights that reveal how strategic priorities in the NBA have shifted across decades.
